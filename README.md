1. Make venv: `python3 -m venv venv`
2. Install requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Allow terminal to access your file system. I strongly recommend turning this off as soon as you're done toying around with this example [link](https://osxdaily.com/2018/10/09/fix-operation-not-permitted-terminal-error-macos/)
4. `sudo python3 get_messages.py`, and observe results in `data/` folder.
