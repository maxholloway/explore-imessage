1. Make and activate venv: `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
2. Install requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Allow terminal to access your file system. I strongly recommend turning this off as soon as you're done toying around with this example [link](https://osxdaily.com/2018/10/09/fix-operation-not-permitted-terminal-error-macos/)
4. Open `get_messages.py` in a text editor of your choice (e.g. `nano get_messages.py`), and change the `USERNAME` constant.
5. `sudo python3 get_messages.py`, and observe results in `data/chat.csv`.

You can also tinker around more with the SQL command to get whatever analytics you desire.
